# C++ Mini-Projects 🚀

A collection of C++ practice projects created during my learning journey. This repository serves as a playground for experimenting with C++ concepts and building practical applications.

## 📁 Repository Structure

This repository uses a two-branch workflow:

### 🌟 **Main Branch**
- **Purpose**: Stable, production-ready code
- **Status**: Fully tested and working
- **Usage**: For contributions and final implementations
- **Quality**: Clean, documented, and reliable

### 🔬 **Master Branch**
- **Purpose**: Development and experimentation
- **Status**: Work in progress, frequent changes
- **Usage**: Testing new features and concepts
- **Quality**: Experimental code, may contain bugs
- **News** : To see what's new, go to this branch

## 🛠️ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler (g++ recommended)
- Basic knowledge of C++

### Compilation
Instead of typing long compilation commands, use our convenient script:

```bash
# Simple compilation
./compiler.sh aula03

# Instead of the full command:
# g++ -I./rectangles/headers rectangles/src/aula03.cpp -o rectangles/aula03
```

### Running Projects
```bash
# After compilation
./rectangles/aula03
```

## 📚 Projects Overview

Each project focuses on different C++ concepts and practical applications:

- **Rectangles**: Object-oriented programming with geometric calculations
- *More projects coming soon...*
